### Dear Reader
<p style="text-align: justify">that's my last commit here. Maybe I will finish this project later... someday in the future. <br>
I wanted to create a simple database for myself. I am a private tutor and a nerd also. I wanted to have all the data about my students and lessons in the same place.<br>
I am too weak... I had a lot of fun ("WHY THA F... IT'S NOT WORKING", this kind of fun) when I was coding it. I gave up when I wanted to do the settings. First, dark mode. I had left it at the end of the work and I read something and realised that I did it totally in the wrong way. Then I was trying to do the language changing. It works... but I am sure that this way to code it is incorrect.<br>
The last point that hurt me the most was the fact that the app is not optimal. When I want to add a new lesson or edit an old one I have to wait 10s or more to see the editing screen.<br> 
That's too much. I did it in a non optimal way and it can't be used as a casual tool. I lost this war...<br>
But there are some positives. I know React Native better than I used to. I learned - more or less - how the useEffect function works. I discovered new modules and started to use it. Now I know I should read the database once and keep it the the memory. I know that (almost everything) async stuff is a piece of shit. Powerful, but piece of shit. <br>
Maybe You are good enough to finish the app. Try if You want. Good luck, Samurai.<br>
<p style="text-align: right">
Yeah, it was funny to code it.<br>
Yours faithfully,<br>
Hubert
